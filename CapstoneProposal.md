#### BomberMan-like game

##### Description
I’d like to explore unity and recreate a top down version of a bomberman style game where a player can walk around and place bombs to destroy breakable objects. Ideally, it would also implement 2 player mode and/or high scores. 

##### Use Case
I suppose nostalgic gamers would be the target audience. The main challenges will be learning a new technology and implementing stored states like high scores. Multiplayer will also be a potential problem, I’m not sure how unity handles local or online multiplayer or multiple input devices for a game state. I expect it to be easier to accomplish than a computer player though.

##### Minimum Viable Product
 * Destructible elements
 * bomb explosion functionality
 * player movement
 * environment collision

##### Tools for MVP
 * Unity
 * C#
 
##### Additional Features
 1. multiplayer
 2. power ups / modifiers (different bombs, player buffs)
 3. randomized level layout (procedurally generated tile maps)
 4. level progression / difficulty progression
 5. high scores
 6. life tracker (multiple tries on a single level before game over)
 7. Persistent player progression/advancement system. (skill tree, etc.)
 8. AI opponents

##### Tools for Additional Features
 * N/A

##### Additional Information

I’m really excited to explore Unity ever since I missed out on working on it on the last team week project. I’m apprehensive to learn a new technology on such short notice, but I think it will be very engaging and fun to mess around with. I don’t have too many stretch goals, but I think a lot of them are pretty unrealistic for the time frame available. Each one will probably take several hours of research and I expect the MVP to take up the allotted time.
