## Description

This is my first foray into Unity as an opportunity to showcase some c# scripting and explore game design. This project recreates the gameplay loop of bomberman with the player clicking to place bombs which interact with explodable terrain to expose coins. Players need to collect as many coins as they can before the time runs out where the score is displayed on the game over screen.
